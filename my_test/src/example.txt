By calculating the time complexity of an algorithm.
it is possible to check, before implementing the algorithm.
that it is efficient enough for the problem.
The starting point for estimations is the fact that a modern computer can perform some hundreds of millions of operations in a second.
For example, assume that the time limit for a problem is one second and the input size is n = 105. If the time complexity is O(n2), the algorithm will perform about (105)2 = 1010 operations. This should take at least some tens of seconds, so the algorithm seems to be too slow for solving the problem.
On the other hand, given the input size, we can try to guess the required time complexity of the algorithm that solves the problem. The following table contains some useful estimates assuming a time limit of one second.
